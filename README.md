Project Jazz is research/application gate where Hardware Integrators and Software Developers meet together to contribute with their skills to make turn-key Solution.

The research/application field is:

# Project-Jazz Open Vision!
We believe to Open Projects, we believe to contributors we don't believe that only big industries could benefit of the contribution of manies.

Any big solution is a contribute of many small.

# Project-Jazz Basic Idea!
We wish to provide a Plug&Play hardware modules integration ready to develop software applications for all the industries that match with the hardware.

We wish to provide also the basic open software application ready to use with this hardware integration.

We don't provide any housing because we believe that each enthusiast, professional, company, inventor or maker should make it by himself. The aim is that anyone that has a good idea within the field of this project could have a startup platform ready for turn-key solution.
