# Project-Jazz ... this unknown!
Project Jazz is research/application gate where Hardware Integrators and Software Developers meet together to contribute with their skills to make turn key solutions.

The research/application field is:
- Computer Vision
- Mapping
- etc.

Why Jazz? ..... because is the same Google Project Tango field (a combination of hardware and software) but Jazz can be inside each rhythm like Tango, Salsa, Pop, Rock, Fusion, Bossa, Disco ...... everywhere and the improvvisation incarnates the soul of each one creating always a different song from the same song! 

# Open Vision!
We believe to Open Projects (software and "hardware"), we believe to contributors but we don't believe that only big industries or few could benefit for the contribution of manies.

We believe in a "democratic" approach of the research, where anybody gives his small knowledge's contribute to obtain a big solution that also each "small" one can reuse.

# Project-Jazz Basic Idea!
We wish to provide a Plug&Play hardware modules integration ready to develop software applications for all the industries that match with the hardware.

We wish to provide also the basic open software application ready to use with this hardware integration.

We don't provide any housing because we believe that each enthusiast, professional, company, inventor or maker should make it by himself. The aim is that anyone that has a good idea within the field of this project could have a startup platform ready for turn-key solution.
